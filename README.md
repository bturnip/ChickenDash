# ChickenDash
NB:
* I built this on and for a Linux setup.  It will not work out of the box with Windows.
* The Python scapy module requires root access for sockets.  The net effect is that I set up root crontab to start my job once a day.
* The text to phone via Gmail is clunky.  I wanted to use the Google Calendar API, but I couldn't get my local argparse to play nice with the Google Calendar API.
